# Hello World
Hey there! I'm Francesco known as Airscript on the web.  
I am a passionate Software Engineer that literally shares happiness with code.

## About Me
Currently I am working as a freelance Software Engineer.  
While doing this, from time to time I contribute to and make my own open source software that span between CLIs, TUIs and guides mostly.  
Other than that I am also a Referent for [Plastic Free](https://www.plasticfreeonlus.it/), a Community Administrator for [Open Source Support](https://t.me/ptkdev_support_italian) and Supporter of [@Pannyloo](https://instagram.com/pannyloo).

## Current Projects
Actually I'm working on growing the audience and value of [Awesome Steam Deck](https://github.com/airscripts/awesome-steam-deck).  
I'm also trying to get better with content creation, making content that spans between videos, posts and blog articles.
For this reason I've created and opened, aside my social channels, a [personal blog](https://blog.airscript.it).
